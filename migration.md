# To migrate from Xonsh v0.12.5 -> v0.13.0

- `free_cwd` xontrib is merged with `xontrib_ptk_shell`.
   On Windows, you can enable this by setting `$XONSH_FREE_CWD = True`
- `whole_word_jumping` xontrib is now merged as well.
   Those shortcuts can now be set by `$XONSH_WHOLE_WORD_SHORTCUTS = True`
